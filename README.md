# Specialised-Netherite

Specialised netherite adds a new mechanic to netherite, crystals, these crystals can be used to give netherite a particular buff, for example, extra enchantability, or more durability, this gives more of a purpose to netherite and more strategy to the game - Do you really want extra attack damage, or would you benefit more from durability.

The process is irreversible and the choice you make will change how you use your tools!

# About Me

This mod is made by me only, except some translations and textures by the community, so it's very slow progress, so if you want to see prerelease versions, subscribe to my patreon! It helps me out alot and gives me motivation for this project

Also, it's worth noting, I don't mind people messaging me and saying hi/giving input on the mods or suggestions, so if you want to tell me a feature personally, then you can see me in discord, similarly to my patreon, it gives me alot of motivation to know that it's a project people are actively using/interested in!
