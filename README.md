# Specialised-Netherite

Specialised netherite adds a new mechanic to netherite, crystals, these crystals can be used to give netherite a particular buff, for example, extra enchantability, or more durability, this gives more of a purpose to netherite and more strategy to the game - Do you really want extra attack damage, or would you benefit more from durability.

The process is irreversible and the choice you make will change how you use your tools!

# About Me

This mod is made by me only, except some translations and textures by the community, so it's very slow progress, so if you want to see prerelease versions, subscribe to my patreon! It helps me out alot and gives me motivation for this project
